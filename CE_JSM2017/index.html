<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Learning is happening increasingly outside of formal educational settings and in unsupervised environments. Technological advantages provide new tools and opportunities for life-time learners. This reading notes is my first step of managing my learning (aka: Personal Knowledge Management). This step is called Personal Information Management(PIM). The goals are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Organize information<br />
</li>
<li>Initially process the information and understand the information structure</li>
<li>Chunking: cluster similar information, filter out some detail, degrade the complexity</li>
</ol>
<p>The reading notes are arranged according to book category in my reading list since 2009. For some reason I lost all reading information before 2009. There are tons of paper notes need to be digitized and I will keep working on it in my spare time. My personal comments will start with “<span style="color:blue">Hui:</span>” in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>. Sometimes I summarize the contents with my own words. It is great if you find any of those notes useful for you as well. I thank all my friends who recommended great books to me. I wrote this notes with R Markdown (Allaire et al. 2016) and the R package bookdown (Xie 2016a). To learn more about R Markdown, please check out the <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">online documentation</a>. For knitr, please see Xie (xie 2015). Here is a guide to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/%5D">authoring books with bookdown</a>.</p>

<!--Obviously, my favorite is "Philosophy and Psychology" .  I have few books on "Politics","Law", "Gender", "Data Science" and "Medicine"......Statistics (31), Data Science (5) and IT(7) [**SDT** area], all these three added together is about the size of "Business & Economics". 


I am a little surprised. Some possible insights are (not all of them necessary to be true):
 
1. Professional area/degree don't tell how a person spend time
1. Scientists read more journal papers and technique reports in corresponding area than books
1. There are not as many books in **SDT** as in some other areas   
1. I didn’t spend enough time in **SDT** 
1. I need to work harder on **SDT**
