# What is a path?

# The term no one really defined

- What is data science?

> Data science is the discipline of making data useful.  Ok...so what is it? 

<img src="images/awesome-me.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:600px;height:400px;">

# Three tracks of data science

1. Engineering (infrastructure and production): the process of making everything else possible 

2. Analysis: the process of turning raw information into insights in a fast way

3. Modeling/Inference: the process of diving deeper into the data to discover the pattern we don't easily see

(It is a group work from https://github.com/brohrer/academic_advisory/blob/master/authors.md !)

# Engineering

- Data environment: data storage, Kafka platform, Hadoop and Spark cluster etc.

- Data management: parsing the logs, web scraping, API queries, and interrogating data streams. 

- Production: integrate model and analysis into the production system


# Analysis

- Domain knowledge

- Exploratory analysis

- Story telling


# Modeling/Inference

- Statistical Inference 

- Supervised learning

- Unsupervised learning

- Customized model development


# Some confusions and more to come

- **Data infrastructure engineer**: _Go,Python, AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, logstash, Kafka, and Hadoop_
- **Data engineer**: _spark/scala, python, SQL, AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, Data modeling_
- **BI engineer**: _Tableau/looker/Mode etc, data visulization, SQL, Python_ 
- **Data analyst**: _SQL, basic statistics, data visualization_
- **Data scientist**: _R/Python, SQL, basic + applied statistics, data visualization, experimental design_
- **Research scientist**: _R/Python, advanced statistics + experimental design, ML, research background, publications, conference contributions, algorithms _
- **Applied scientist**: _Similar to research scientist, ML algorithm design, often with an expectation of basic software engineering skills_
- **Machine Learning Engineer**: _More advanced software engineering skillset, algorithms, machine learning algorithm design, system design_

# Where does data science belong in your organization?

<center>**1. A standalone team** </center>

- An autonomous unit parallel to engineering
- A strategic differentiator for the organization
- The head of data science unit should ideally report into the CEO or at least report into someone who understands data strategy and is willing to invest to give it what it needs. 
- Pros: 
    - autonomy
    - well positioned to tackle whatever problems it deems most valuable 
    - knowledge share and grow
    - attract/retain talent
- Cons: risk of marginalization

# Where does data science belong in your organization?

<center>**2. An embedded model**</center>

- Bring in talented people and farms them out to the rest of the company. There’s still a head of data science, but he/she is mostly a hiring manager and coach.
- Give up autonomy to ensure utility
- Pros: 
    - closer to applications
    - flexibility
- Cons: 
    - hard to attract/retain talent 
    - their embedded team leads don’t feel responsible for their growth and happiness, while their managers won’t feel directly vested in their work
    - data scientists are second-class citizens everywhere

# Where does data science belong in your organization?

<center>**3. Integrated team**</center>

- No separate data science team; each team hires and manages its own data scientists.
- Pros: 
    - optimizes for organizational alignment; 
- Cons: 
    - dilutes the identity of data science; 
    - hurt data scientist's career growth; 
    - sacrifice the flexibility of the embedded model

# Regardless of the company stage...

# Regardless of the company stage...

- Every company claims to be data driven, but they are different...
- How do you want to be driven by data?
- Team matters!
    > Happy teams are all alike; every unhappy team is unhappy in its own way

- Product matters, but don't join a company because of the product!
- If you want to be Google employee #20, you need to join Google when it had only 19 employees

# Interview

- General:
    - Recruiter
    - Technical interview (1-2 rounds)
    - Onsite or take home
    
# Interview

- General:
    - Recruiter
    - Technical interview (1-2 rounds)
    - Onsite or take home
    
- My two cents: 
  - It is all about fit
  - There is certain amount of luck
  - Job searching is weary and the emotional roller coaster feels like sh**
  - You are getting better each time

# What to do during COVID-19?

- No sugar-coating, it is difficult!
- There are things that are way more important than your career
- Get used to virtual interview
- Think short term
- Take online course and sharpen your skill
- Consider sectors that are ramping up their hiring: Blue Apron, Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Zoom
- Be an efficient remote worker
- Many people are happy to help!
