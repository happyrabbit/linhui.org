<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is data science?</h2>
<p>David Donoho <span class="citation">(Donoho <a href="#ref-data50">2015</a>)</span> summarizes in “50 Years of Data Science” the main recurring “Memes” about data sciences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The ‘Big Data’ Meme</li>
<li>The ‘Skills’ Meme</li>
<li>The ‘Jobs’ Meme</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone should have heard about big data. Data science trainees now need the skills to cope with such big data sets. What are those skills? You may hear about: Hadoop, a system using Map/Reduce to process large data sets distributed across a cluster of computers. The new skills are for dealing with organizational artifacts of large-scale cluster computing but not for better solving the real problem. A lot of data on its own is worthless. It isn’t the size of the data that’s important. It’s what you do with it. The big data skills that so many are touting today are not skills for better solving the real problem of inference from data.</p>
<p>We are transiting to universal connectivity with a deluge of data filling telecom servers. But these facts don’t immediately create a science. The statisticians and computer scientists have been laying the groundwork for data science for at least 50 years. Today’s data science is an enlargement and combination of statistics and computer science rather than a brand new discipline.</p>
<p>Data Science doesn’t come out of the blue. Its predecessor is data analysis. Back in 1962, John Tukey wrote in “The Future of Data Analysis”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a long time I have thought I was a statistician, interested in inferences from the particular to the general. But as I have watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have had cause to wonder and to doubt. …All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It deeply shocked his academic readers. Aren’t you supposed to present something mathematically precise, such as definitions, theorems, and proofs? If we use one sentence to summarize what John said, it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>data analysis is more than mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In September 2015, the University of Michigan made plans to invest $100 million over the next five years in a new Data Science Initiative (DSI) that will enhance opportunities for student and faculty researchers across the university to tap into the enormous potential of big data. How does DSI define Data science? Their website gives us an idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This coupling of scientific discovery and practice involves the collection, management, processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of vast amounts of heterogeneous data associated with a diverse array of scientific, translational, and interdisciplinary applications.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about data scientist? Here is a list of somewhat whimsical definitions for a “data scientist”:</p>
<ul>
<li>“A data scientist is a data analyst who lives in California”</li>
<li>“A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.”</li>
<li>“A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco.”</li>
<li>“Data Science is statistics on a Mac.”</li>
</ul>
<p>There is lots of confusion between Data Scientist, Statistician, Business/Financial/Risk(etc.) Analyst and BI professional due to the apparent intersections among skillsets. We see data science as a discipline to make sense of data. The techniques and methodologies of data science stem from the fields of computer science and statistics. One of the most well-cited diagrams describing the area comes from Drew Conway where he suggested data science is the intersection of hacking skills, math and stats knowledge, and substantial expertise. This diagram might be a bit of an oversimplification, but it’s a great start.</p>
<p>In the obscenity case of Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964), Potter Stewart wrote in his short concurrence that “hard-core pornography” was hard to define, but that “I know it when I see it.” This applies to many things including data science. It is hard to define, but you know it when you see it.</p>
<p>So instead of figuring out a good definition, we are going to sketch the history of data science, show you what kind of questions data science can answer, and describe the skills required for being a data scientist. We hope this can give you a better depiction of data science.</p>

<p>In the early 19th century when Legendre and Gauss came up the least squares method for linear regression, only physicists would use it to fit linear regression. Now, even non-technical people can fit linear regressions using excel. In 1936 Fisher came up with linear discriminant analysis. In the 1940s, we had another widely used model – logistic regression. In the 1970s, Nelder and Wedderburn formulated “generalized linear model (GLM)” which:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“generalized linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.” [from Wikipedia]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the 1970s, there was a range of analytical models and most of them were linear because computers were not powerful enough to fit non-linear model until the 1980s.</p>
<p>In 1984 Breiman et al. introduced classification and regression tree (CART) which is one of the oldest and most utilized classifications and regression techniques. After that Ross Quinlan came up with more tree algorithms such as ID3, C4.5, and C5.0. In the 1990s, ensemble techniques (methods that combine many models’ predictions) began to appear. Bagging is a general approach that uses bootstrapping in conjunction with any regression or classification model to construct an ensemble. Based on the ensemble idea, Breiman came up with random forest in 2001. Later, Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire came up with the AdaBoost.M1 algorithm. Benefiting from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the possibility to distribute that via the internet, the toolbox has been expanding fast. The applications include business, health, biology, social science, politics, etc.</p>
<p>John Tukey identified four forces driving data analysis (there was no “data science” then):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The formal theories of math and statistics</li>
<li>Acceleration of developments in computers and display devices</li>
<li>The challenge, in many fields, of more and ever larger bodies of data</li>
<li>The emphasis on quantification in an ever wider variety of disciplines</li>
</ol>
<p>Tukey’s 1962 list is surprisingly modern. Let’s inspect those points in today’s context. There is always a time gap between a theory and its application. We had the theories much earlier than application. Fortunately, for the past 50 years, statisticians have been laying the theoretical groundwork for constructing “data science” today. The development of computers enables us to calculate much faster and deliver results in a friendly and intuitive way. The striking transition to the internet of things generates vast amounts of commercial data. Industries have also sensed the value of exploiting that data. Data science seems certain to be a major preoccupation of commercial life in coming decades. All the four forces John identified exist today and have been driving data science.</p>
