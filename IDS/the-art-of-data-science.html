<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> The art of data science</h1>
<p>Data science and data scientist have become buzz words. Allow me to reiterate what you may have already heard a million times in the media: <strong>data scientists are in demand and demand continues to grow</strong>. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute concludes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a shortage of the analytical and managerial talent necessary to make the most of Big Data is a significant and pressing challenge (for the U.S.).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may expect that statisticians and graduate students from traditional statistics departments are great data scientist candidates. But the situation is that the majority of current data scientists do not have a statistical background. As David Donoho pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“statistics is being marginalized here; the implicit message is that statistics is a part of what goes on in data science but not a very big part.” ( from “<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/784-fall15/50YearsDataScience.pdf">50 years of Data Science</a>”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is wrong? The activities that preoccupied statistics over centuries are now in the limelight, but those activities are claimed to belong to a new discipline and are practiced by professionals from various backgrounds. Various professional statistics organizations are reacting to this confusing situation. (Page 5-7, “50 Years of Data Science”) From those discussions, Donoho summarizes the main recurring “Memes” about data sciences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The ‘Big Data’ Meme</li>
<li>The ‘Skills’ Meme</li>
<li>The ‘Jobs’ Meme</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two are linked together which leads to statisticians’ current position on data science. We assume everyone has heard the 3V (volume, variety and velocity) definition of big data. The media hasn’t taken a minute break from touting “big” data. Data science trainees now need the skills to cope with such big data sets. What are those skills? You may hear about: Hadoop, system using Map/Reduce to process large data sets distributed across a cluster of computers. The new skills are for dealing with organizational artifacts of large-scale cluster computing but not for better solving the real problem. A lot of data on its own is worthless. It isn’t the size of the data that’s important. It’s what you do with it. The big data skills that so many are touting today are not skills for better solving the real problem of inference from data.</p>
<p>Some media think they sense the trends in hiring and government funding. We are transiting to universal connectivity with a deluge of data filling telecom servers. But these facts don’t immediately create a science. The statisticians have been laying the groundwork of data science for at least 50 years. Today’s data science is an enlargement of traditional academic statistics rather than a brand new discipline.</p>
<!--Our goal is to help you enlarge your background to become a data scientist in US enterprise environments. We will use case studies to cover how to leverage big data distributed platforms (Hadoop / Hive / Spark), data wrangling, modeling, dynamic reporting (R markdown) and interactive dashboards (R-Shiny) to tackle real-world data science problems. One typical skill gap for statisticians is data ETL (extraction, transformation and load) in production environments, and we will cover this topic as well. Data science is a combination of science and art with data as the foundation. We will also cover the “art” part to guide participants to learn soft skills to define data science problems and to effectively communicate with business stakeholders. The prerequisite knowledge is MS level education in statistics and entry level knowledge of R-Studio.-->
