<!--begin excerpt-->
Hey, I am a Chinese girl who is now living in a cute place named Ames in US. I am a vegan; 
I love yoga, and statistics .
<!--end excerpt-->Life here taught me how to dance in snow. The world is not 
perfect because human nature is not perfect. However, I am truly grateful about my life. 
Different people come to me. Some left me soon; some I thought would stay but left me eventually;
Some stay until now. I thanks those who have come to me and taught me things. If you want to know
more about me, here is a [navigation for my kindom] (http://linhui.org/happyrabbit.html) . Keep happy everyone! : ) 

This website layout is a fork of [Sreejith Kesavan](http://foobarnbaz.com/) with some minor modifications. It is still 
under construction.  Thanks Sreejith Kesavan!
