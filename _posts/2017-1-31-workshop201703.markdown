ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

Social media have created a reverberating "echoverse" for brand communication, forming complex feedback loops between 
the "universe" of corporate communications, news media, and user-generated social media. Prof. William Rand will 
talk about using computational linguistics techniques to analyze longitudinal unstructured data to understand these 
feedback loops. He will also talk about building agent-based decision support systems for word-of-mouth programs.  
It will be online and you can watch the live broadcasting on YouTube or watch the recorded video later.
