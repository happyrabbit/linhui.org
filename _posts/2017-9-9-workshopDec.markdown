ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

We develop a flexible methodology to protect marketing data in the context of a business ecosystem in which data 
providers seek to meet the information needs of data users, but wish to deter the invalid use of the data by 
potential intruders. In this context, we propose a Bayesian probability model that produces protected synthetic data. 
A key feature of our proposed method is that the data provider can balance the trade-off between information 
loss resulting from data protection and risk of disclosure to intruders. We apply our methodology 
to the problem facing a vendor of retail point-of-sale data whose customers use the data to estimate 
price elasticities and promotion effects. At the same time, the data provider wishes to protect the identities of 
sample stores from possible intrusion. We define metrics to measure the average and maximum loss of protection 
implied by a data protection method. We show that, by enabling the data provider to choose the degree of 
protection to infuse into the synthetic data, our method performs well relative to seven benchmark data 
protection methods, including the extant approach of aggregating data across stores.
