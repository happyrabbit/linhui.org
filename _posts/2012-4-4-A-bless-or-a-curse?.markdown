<!--begin excerpt-->What, other than the tourism, do the long history and splendid culture of ancient Egypt bring to Egyptian?<!--end excerpt-->

Egyptian Cultural Relics are straight, from armor to city wall. For me, straight line is the simplest shape in geometric drawing ------ without any ambiguity and imagination.

The history and culture were made as a mummy that would never been decomposed and never move on. Egyptian today are like guards for the garden of ancient culture 6000 years ago. What about Egyptian 1000 year later? Being guards for the ancient culture 7000 years ago? What is the meaning of inheriting the history?

A bless or a curse?
