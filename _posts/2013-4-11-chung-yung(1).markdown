Chung-yung is a central document in the Confucian tradition. It is also known as the Doctrine of the Mean. As an important chapter in one of the Five Classics, Chung-yung has continuously been a source of inspiration for the creative mind in Chinese intellectual history for more than two thousand years. Chu-Hsi (1130-1200), the great Confucian synthesizer, included Chung-yung as one of the Four Books. After that, it became as influential on traditional Chinese education as the Analects. It was a basic text for civil-service examinations from 1313 to 1905 in China. The mode of thinking presented in Chung-yung was rooted in Chinese' mind and is still readily perceivable as a defining characteristic of many a philosophical reflection in contemporary China.  The Doctrine of the Mean is more than keeping balance without going extreme. There is a deep, integral structure in Chung-yung. 

In the busy modern life, how many Chinese will have the patience to read a passage from ancient literature? It is a little sad to further ask how many Chinese who are living in US will pay attention to Chinese ancient philosophy. I doubt the next generation, so called American born Chinese,  even know there exists such amazing wisdom.  In front of the wisdom from God, no trouble will trouble me. I am trying here to write things about the chinese classic, Chung-yung, in English. It helps to reflect and penetrate the surface semantics and arrive at an appreciation of its inner meanings. I believe there are wisdom from God, like those in Bible, which are the living water  of life.
