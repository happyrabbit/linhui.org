ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

In today’s retailing environment, consumers and sellers interact through multiple channels (e.g., online channels include email, search engines, banner ads, affiliate websites, comparison shopping websites, etc.). It is critical for a seller to understand the roles played by different touchpoints on a consumer’s interactions with a firm. In this talk, Prof. Kinshuk Jerath will discuss some of his research on customer analytics in a multichannel world. The talk will include two papers: 

- An Information Stock Model of Customer Behavior in Multichannel Customer Support Services
- Multichannel Path-to-Purchase: Channels as “Engagers” and “Closers”

individuals, and the interactions between them. Specifically, his research has examined the role of information technology 
in three areas – (1) How customers use technology mediated channels with traditional channels in multichannel sales and after sales 
services settings, such as retail of traditional goods (apparel and home goods), digital goods (digital movies and music), and after 
sales services in insurance sector. (2) How online product recommendation network affects customers demand. (3) How technology can be
 utilized to remedy societal problems, such as remedying education with the use of personalization technologies. To answer these questions,
  Professor Kumar has designed natural, quasi-natural, and large scale randomized experiments in real-life field settings.
