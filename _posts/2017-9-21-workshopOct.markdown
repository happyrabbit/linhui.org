ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

In today’s retailing environment, consumers and sellers interact through multiple channels (e.g., online channels include email, search engines, banner ads, affiliate websites, comparison shopping websites, etc.). It is critical for a seller to understand the roles played by different touchpoints on a consumer’s interactions with a firm. In this talk, Prof. Kinshuk Jerath will discuss some of his research on customer analytics in a multichannel world. The talk will include two papers: 

- An Information Stock Model of Customer Behavior in Multichannel Customer Support Services
- Multichannel Path-to-Purchase: Channels as “Engagers” and “Closers”
