ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

This talk introduces a new randomization method for conducting networked experiments. Balanced randomization configuration is one of the most important concerns for successful comparative studies.  However, chance imbalance still exists in many traditional experiments.  Under the assumption of random dot product graphs, the proposed method generates more balanced assignments of the units to the treatment and control groups compared with the traditional randomization methods.  The proposed method can be used for directed or undirected graphs with or without vertex covariate information.  In addition, under the linear model setting, the proposed method achieves the optimal randomization balance asymptotically.  Numerical studies provide further evidence of the advantages of the proposed method.
