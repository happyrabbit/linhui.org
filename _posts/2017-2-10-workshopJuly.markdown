ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

There is growing interest in “customer-based corporate valuation,” tying the value of a firm's customers to 
overall valuation. The speaker will talk about a novel methodology based upon “indirect inference” to value 
firms by connecting common customer data summaries, which many firms disclose, with the parameters of latent 
variable models for customer behavior.
