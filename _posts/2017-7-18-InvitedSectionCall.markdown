</font></strong></p>

 
2018 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) will be in **Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from July 28 - August 2, 2018**. 
**Section on Statistics in Marketing** is soliciting proposals for invited sessions. The theme for JSM 2018 is “**#LeadWithStatistics**,” but not all sessions have to adhere to this theme. Formats vary for invited sessions; however, all are 110 minutes in length and have a session chair. The sessions typically include 2–6 participants, including the chair. There are two of the most popular and successful formats: 

(1) 2–3 speakers with a discussant;  
(2) A panel discussion of 3–5 panelists

Please reference the call for invited sessions published in [Amstat News](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2017/07/01/jsm2018proposals/).  The online submission process is open on **Tuesday, July 18, 2017, and will close on Wednesday, September 6, 2017 (11:59 p.m. EST)**.
The website for submissions is [http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/submissions.cfm](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/submissions.cfm)
