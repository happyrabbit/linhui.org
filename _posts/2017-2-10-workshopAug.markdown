ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

Anecdotal evidence suggests consumers visit news outlets that are government controlled (GC) and pro-government biased 
even in the presence of independent news outlets. One explanation is that consumers’ exhibit preference for pro-government 
bias in the news. Alternatively, the evidence may reflect a preference for GC website characteristics that are unobserved 
to the researcher, such as quality. Disentangling between these two potential explanations for consumers' demand has 
important implications for our understanding of the role of government control in online news markets. In this talk, 
Andrey Simonov will talk about his research on consumers’ preference for (un)biased news and show some interesting 
findings. Andrey’s work is a good example of analyzing social media based on econometrics and online text mining.
