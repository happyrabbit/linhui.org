ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing. 
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and 
future workshops at: [http://scientistcafe.com/](http://scientistcafe.com/).  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing 
[here](http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home).  

Companies are being flooded with tsunamis of data collected in a multichannel business environment, 
leaving an untapped potential for analytics to better understand, manage and strategically exploit the complex dynamics 
of customer behavior.  In this webinar, we will start by providing a bird’s eye overview of the analytics process model 
and then illustrate how to fully unleash its power in some example settings.  We will review data as the key ingredient 
of any analytical model and discuss how to measure its quality.  We will zoom into the key requirements of good analytical 
models (e.g. statistical validity, interpretability, operational efficiency, regulatory compliance etc.) and discuss 
emerging applications.  The webinar will provide a mix of both theoretical and technical insights, as well as practical 
implementation details. The presenter will also extensively report on his recent research insights about the topic. 
Various real-life case studies and examples will be used for further clarification.
