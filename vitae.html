Binary Data</em></a>

<!--
, Advisor: Prof. Chong Wang, Department of Statistics, Iowa State University</li> 
<blockquote style="text-align:justify">The second project of my PhD thesis was originally motivated by the common 
practice of pooling diagnostic tests. Matched observations with dichotomous responses commonly occur in medical 
and epidemiological studies. Although standard approaches exist for one-to-one paired binary data analyses, not much 
work has been produced for the case where we have one-to-two or one-to-N matched binary data. The existing Miettinen's 
test assumes that the multiple observations from the same matched set are mutually independent. In this paper, 
we propose exact and asymptotic tests for one-to-two matched binary data. Our method is in markedly different from 
previously proposed methods in that we do not rely on the mutual independence assumption. The emphasis on dependence 
among observations from the same matched set is natural and appealing, in both human health and in veterinary medicine 
studies. The method we propose can be applied to many kinds of diagnostic studies that have a one-to-two matched data 
structure. Our methods can also be generalized to the one-to-N matched case in a straightforward manner.

href="http://scientistcafe.com/works/AME_Draft_Hui_Mar20.pdf"><em>Distribution of Non-normal, Dependent Bivariates with Additive Measurement Error</em></a>

<!--, Advisor:
Prof. Alicia Carriquiry, Department of Statistics, Iowa State University<br/>

<blockquote style="text-align:justify">This is the third part of my PhD thesis. We consider the problem of estimating the j
oint distribution of  two correlated random variables where one is observed with error.  An example in nutrition is 
estimation of the joint distribution of usual energy intake and usual micronutrient intake. While precise 
biomarkers for energy consumption are available, there are no reliable biomarkers of consumption for nutrients 
including vitamins and minerals (vitamin K is an exception). Yet, nutritionists are interested in estimating 
the distribution of usual intake of micronutrients per unit of caloric intake. This is denoted the nutrient density of 
the diet and involves estimation of the distribution of the ratio of two non-normal random variables, one of which is 
observed with measurement error.  We develop an approach that combines a deconvolution kernel method (DKM) and the 
method of copulas to estimate the joint distribution of two non-normal variables where one is contaminated. 
DKM is first used to adjust the univariate measurement error. A Gaussian copula is then used to model the correlation 
structure between the two variables after error adjustment.  We carried out a small simulation study to investigate 
whether the two-step method we propose is promising.  At least in the context of our simulation, we found that the
approach produces good results when the correlation between the two random variables is reasonably high.  
Our findings are tentative, however,  and more research is needed before we can recommend the methodology for 
use broader.</blockquote>
