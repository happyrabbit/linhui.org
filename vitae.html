<h3>Research Experience</h3>

<li><strong>Jun.2012- Present, Consultant,</strong> Statistical Consulting for Business College, Iowa State University</li>
<li><strong>Apr.2012- Present, Research Assistant,</strong> <em>Exact Test for Difference in Proportions Based on One-to-two Matched
Binary Data</em>, Advisor: Prof. Chong Wang, Department of Statistics, Iowa State University</li> 
<blockquote style="text-align:justify">
We proposed statistical tests for one-to-two matched binary data. Our methods fit more general situation without assuming observations from the same subject are mutually independent. It can be applied to all kinds of diagnostic studies with one-to-two matched data structure other than dual sample pooling, such as one-to-two case control study etc. We extended our methods to more general one to more matched case.</blockquote>
<li><strong>Nov.2011- Present, Research Assistant,</strong> <em>Distribution of Non-normal, Dependent Bivariates with Additive Measurement Error</em>, Advisor:
Prof. Alicia Carriquiry, Department of Statistics, Iowa State University<br/>

<blockquote style="text-align:justify">We proposed a method to estimate the distribution of non-normal, dependent bivariates with additive measurement error by two steps. In the first step,  de-convoluting kernel density estimator and MANOVA were used to adjust the effect of measurement error. In the second step, we used a piece-wise linear approximation to generate bivariate non-normal random variables based on the adjusted sample from previous step.  Some researchers came up approaches to estimate univariate distribution subject to measurement error but no one so far has came up a way to do with bi-variable dependent case.  
An implementation of generating bi-variate non-normal random variables can be found in our R-package "BTNorm". We haven't submitted the package but <a href="http://hui.us.com/Hui's_files/BTNorm.pdf" > <em> here is the help document</em></a>  and let me know if you are interested in any of the source code. </blockquote>
