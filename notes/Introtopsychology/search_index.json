["b-f-skinner.html", "1.1 B.F. Skinner", " 1.1 B.F. Skinner 1960s and 1970s, major figure, dominated American intellectual life with his radical theory Freud invented Psychoanalysis pretty much from scratch. Skinner came late into the field, but he packaged these ideas. He expanded upon them and he presented them as an articulated theory, the Theory of Behaviorism emphasis on learning: everything you know, everything you are is the result of your experience.Prior to Skinner, this idea was nicely summed up by John Watson, who said, “Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take anyone at random, train them to become any specialist I may select–doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, passions, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.” Anti-mentalism: see behaviorism as the backlash against the excesses of Freud get away from unscientific things: desires, wishes, goals, beliefs, and emotions stick to scientific things: stimulus, responses, feature of the environment no interesting differences across species: the only difference between a person and a rat is what they could come to know lies in the situations in which they are raised "],
["habituation.html", "1.2 Habituation", " 1.2 Habituation what is it? habituation as a declining tendency to respond to stimuli that are familiar due to repeated exposure. → we get used to things, we might react strongly to something that we experienced for the first time, but if we experienced it over and over again, we’ll react less strongly. What is it for? an adaptive mechanism to keep us focusing on new objects and events. Similarly for any of us dealing with our environments, something new should capture attention, something old less so, because we already know about it. It turns out habituation is an extremely important learning mechanism. Without it, I’m not sure how we could survive in the world. "],
["classical-conditioning.html", "1.3 Classical conditioning", " 1.3 Classical conditioning What is it? the learning of an association between one stimulus and another stimulus. This mechanism can best be illustrated through a famous experiment by the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Ivan Pavlov. What is it for? Sensitivity to a cue that an event is about to happen allows you to prepare for that event. Q: what is the optimal timing between the conditional stimulus and un-conditional stimulus? It turns out it’s not best when they’re simultaneous, rather the connection best when the conditioned stimulus comes immediately before the unconditioned stimulus. This makes sense if you think that neurological system underlying classical conditioning is built so that you can prepare and anticipate. "],
["instrumental-conditioning-aka-operant-conditioning.html", "1.4 Instrumental Conditioning (aka operant conditioning)", " 1.4 Instrumental Conditioning (aka operant conditioning) What is it? The learning of an association between actions and rewards or punishments. What is it for? Learning what works and what doesn’t This is different from classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is passive. Instrumental conditioning is based on your own action. You act on the world and then the way the world treats your actions shapes the nature of your future actions. Skinner didn’t devise the idea of instrumental conditioning but built on it. This was his major theoretical and experimental research program was focusing on the extent to which operant conditioning could shape the behavior of humans and of other animals. The theoretical foundations for operant conditioning were established by the psychologist, Edward Thorndike. Thorndike noticed in his studies that animals don’t seem to learn through sudden insight, but rather through a series of random activities that they get better and better at. His example was putting a cat in a puzzle box. Thorndike summarized what was going on here, as the law of effect, the tendency to perform an action is increased if rewarded, weakened if not. Suppose you have to train a pig. How would you train a pig? What you would do is, you would reinforce it. There are two types of reinforcement, there’s positive reinforcement, giving it something it wants, and negative reinforcement, releasing it from something aversive. If the pig is doing something you want it to do you could reinforce it, and if it’s doing something you don’t want it to do, you could punish it. But that’s really limited because suppose you wanted to make the pig do something it’s never done before, like dance, well you can’t just wait for it to dance and then reinforce it. It will never do that. Shaping: When the pig moves in a certain way that approximates dancing, you reward it, and now it’ll start to do that. Then when it moves in that way and another way and it’s looking even more like dancing, you reward it again. In other words, as the pig gradually approximate the behavior you hope it to do, you reward it on its way. Skinner described shaping as analogous to natural selection. The way eyes evolve is, animals evolve something that very roughly approximates, something approximating something like an eye, which leads to increased survival and reproduction. Then you have step by step by step by step until they evolve complex structures. But real life doesn’t work that way. There are all sorts of partial reinforcement in the world, in which we get reinforced some of the time, and not all of the time. Schedules of reinforcement fixed ratio variable ratio fixed interval variable interval "],
["scientific-assessment-of-skinner.html", "1.5 Scientific assessment of Skinner", " 1.5 Scientific assessment of Skinner no innate knowledge. These three mechanisms are all an animal would need. The second is anti-mentalism. You would explain mental life without mental stuff like desires and goals, but just through principles that linked up stimulus and response. these learning mechanisms will work for any stimulus and any response. And for any animal, the way humans learn is no different in principle from how rats learn, and how monkeys learn, and how pigeons learn At least to some extent that these three claims are mistaken. there’s a lot of evidence for unlearned knowledge. There was evidence for innate contribution to capacities like learning language, perceiving a physical world, understanding numbers, certain aspects of sexual preference, and so on. Even when it comes to learning, which is the focus of behaviorism, it turns out different animals have different learning mechanisms. The way birds learn birds’ song seems quite different from the way that humans learn the language. The way some animals learn to navigate is just different from the way other animals learn to do this. The way some animals form attachments or develop cooperative behavior is often special to that sort of species of animal. And none of this is that surprising, natural selection will take different creatures on different paths. As for the sort of middle proposal that is unscientific to talk about observables. In some way, this is an understandable reaction to Freud. Who made all sorts of dramatic claims that were unfalsifiable and difficult to pin down and horribly vague. But the truth is that all sciences talk about observables. Biologists talked about genes even before we even knew what one looked like. Physicists talk about string theory. For psychology, when explaining a complex and intelligent mechanism, it makes sense to appeal to internal representation. One of the objections to behavior is that it’s crazy to deny that we think even if we don’t move that we have dreams, that we have fantasies, that we deliberate over things, and a behaviorist might say that’s fine, but that’s not scientific. But to explain even the most basic of human behaviors, you need to appeal to these internal representations, and true as well for animals. Animals, for instance, get better and better at learning something even without reinforcement and punishment. There is a rich literature developed by the psychologist Tolman, on what’s called latent learning, which is learning without any sort of feedback. You could imagine yourself looking over a map or making your way through a house, and coming to understand the spatial arrangement without any sort of reinforcement. The idea that reinforcement, at least in any sort of specific concrete sense, is not plausible. And here’s a nice illustration of an experiment that shows how animals might really do in an interesting sense, have maps in their head. [laboratory rats are more capable of more than trial and error learning]. Let’s step back to a broader question. Does behaviorism in general provide good explanations for human action? Skinner made the case for it in his classic and quite wonderful book, Verbal Behavior. But Verbal Behavior was subject to a book review by the linguist and public intellectual Noam Chomsky. And this book review became actually the most, I think, important book review in human intellectual history. I think it’s fair to say that Chomsky’s critiques in this book review shattered the foundations of behaviorism. In his review, he analyzed Skinner’s claims in their own right. In particular, his claim that human behavior is shaped by reinforcement and punishment. At least when it comes to people, these notions are either flat wrong or so vague as to be unfalsifiable and uninteresting. So Chomsky points out for instance that Skinner raises questions like why do people talk to ourselves or why do we imitate things sometimes or create art? Give bad news to enemies or fantasize without pleasant situations. What Skinner says is for each of these, it’s reinforcement. We do this because it’s reinforcing. Chomsky’s point is this. It’s either false or empty. It’s not literally true that these things are reinforcing in the sense that you get some sort of food, or pat on the head, or gift, or something that gives you pleasure as soon as you do it. When I talk to myself, I don’t get any prize for it, I just like talking to myself sometimes. When I fantasize, the fantasy itself is its own reward, but there’s no reinforcement. Skinner could say that you do get reinforcement, it’s just more abstract, it’s rewarding, and that’s the reinforcement. Chomsky’s point here is, when you make reinforcement so abstract, you lose any explanatory power. You just say we like it because we like it. If Skinner is forced to say that creating art is reinforcing because we like creating art, that just comes down to the claim we create art because we like creating art, which is true, but psychologically uninteresting. And so it may well be that Skinner’s theory of punishment and reinforcement when made really explicit, in a way we did when we talked about training a pig or something, is a wonderful explanation of animal learning and the training of animals. But it seems to fall short when explaining why humans do what we do. Move beyond the Chomsky critique. It’s not actually true that our behaviors are the product of the law of effect. Because sometimes, we actually come to insights. If I was stuck in the puzzle box, I wouldn’t flail away and do 100 things. Rather, I would think about it. I’d model it in my head, figure out what works and act upon it. So where does this leave us? The legacy of behaviorism: It has given us a richer understanding of some very important learning mechanisms. There may be much more in our head, there may be innate knowledge, there may be insight, but I can’t imagine anybody doubting that we have the capacity for habituation, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning. And then this can explain certain really important aspects of human thought and human behavior. behaviorism and particularly the work of Skinner, has given as powerful tools for training and for teaching for people including children but also for non-verbal creatures, and has been an important contribution to the world in that. But it underestimates the scope and power of human mental life. If the problem of Freud is that his theories were too all-encompassing and too vague and too ungrounded in empirical effect to ultimately become a successful theory of the mind. The problem with Skinner is that when taken specifically, his theories just fail to explain the richness of human mental life. We’ll talk about all sorts of things about the mind that the ideas of behaviorism are simply not sufficient to address. Just like Freud, Skinner’s ideas live on. There’s a lot to behaviorism that even now the most nativist, the most cognitive psychologist still has to contend with "],
["development.html", "Chapter 2 Development", " Chapter 2 Development Developmental psychology deals with foundational questions morality and the origin of moral thought. Two very different views: we start off as immoral or at best amoral we’re basically good then we can be corrupted (Jean-Jacques Rousseau). In contemporary discussions, we talk about prejudice and racism, and they’ll insist that we’re not naturally, prejudice or racist. We can become that way is because of the corrupting influence of culture. The extent to which the way we are right now, was sort of set in stone. Either when we were born, because of our genes, or at least but a time or two or three. It’s an interesting question for instance, how much an interview with a three-year-old can predict the way the three-year-old would turn out. It turns out that when studies are done, a 90-minute interview for three-year-old does predict personality on certain standard scales, the quality of their personal relationships, whether or not they have a job, criminal behavior, and so on. how much of what we know now we’re born with, and how much we have to learn? Psychologists, developmental psychologists talk about three different views, empiricism, which is we start off empty and then we learn and learn and learn and learn. You’ve seen this in the last lecture and discussions of behaviors and this was the behaviors idea. Nativism, which is associative Noam Chomsky, rejects the idea that learning plays a critical role and it says, we actually are born with rich powerful structure systems in our brain. constructivist (John Piaget) I’m going to talk about this in the next two sections and you’ll see that it shares with the empiricist view. The idea of learning, interaction dealing with the environment, makes us who we are. But it shares with the nativist view, the idea that the mind is actually quite complex, and the course of learning is not merely the accumulation of information, let alone the accumulation of conditioned responses, but rather something far more interesting and far more elegant.

["piaget.html", "2.1 Piaget", " 2.1 Piaget Jean Piaget was the founder of the modern study of developmental psychology. His research program was genetic epistemology and he was interested in the development of knowledge in the human species. He pursued his research by looking at it in children. ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny: you can see the development of the species is repeated, recapitulated, in the development of every individual. Piaget thought of children as active thinkers, constantly trying to construct more advanced understandings of the world. described these understandings as schemas these schemas were frameworks that develop to help organize knowledge. two psychological mechanisms that lead to the transformation of these schemas and the creation of new schemas. 1) assimilation: the process of taking in new information and new experiences and matching it up with an already existing schema. 2) accommodation: the process by which existing schemas are changed, or new schemas are created, in order to fit the new information and new experience. Approach: he asked children to solve problems, and then asked them about their reasoning behind the solution. View: children think in entirely different ways than adults. So he’s not a nativist suggesting that children know it all from the start nor is he an empiricist or a behaviorist who viewed learning simply as the accumulation of new knowledge. Or for the behaviorist, new conditioning and new responses. Rather, Piaget believed that children have theories of the world, and so do we. And children’s theories are very different from ours. he proposed that theories transform and that you could capture the development in terms of a series of stages. Each stage corresponding to a different style of thinking, a different way of making sense of how the world works. Different from Freud’s psychosexual theory, Piaget’s theory is more intellectual and scientific grounding. "],

And what this means is that the myelin [ˈmaɪəlɪn] sheath [ʃiːθ] around neurons that makes them run faster and more effectively takes time to develop. This develops all the way through adolescence. In fact, more generally parts of the brain are not fully developed until quite late in life.

["basic-facts-about-language.html", "3.1 Basic facts about language", " 3.1 Basic facts about language Every human society has language: fits with Darwin’s idea that language is instinctive and natural, it shows up everywhere. This doesn’t show that languages is instinctive or that is built into the brain. Because language might have even been invented once and spread through history. But there’s good reason to believe that it’s not and that Darwin is right. Creolization [ˌkriːələˈzeɪʃn]: it involves people who are involved in the slave trade, the production of tobacco, cotton, coffee, sugar who would bring together and mix slaves and laborers from different language backgrounds. So these people would work together but they didn’t have a common language. What often happens is they develop a makeshift jargon which is called a pidgin, P-I-D-G-I-N which involve strings of words borrowed from the language of the plantation owners, often from people’s own native tongues. But there’s no word or no grammar, imagine yourself locked in a room working with a bunch of people with no common language, but you had to work together so you’d make a sort of common communication system. Now, the question which arises is, the children in these societies, the children of the slaves were often brought up independently from their parents in a collective setting and what they heard was mostly a pidgin, and so the question is what would they come to know? And you might imagine well, you’re exposed to a pidgin, you’ll learn a pidgin. But this isn’t actually what happens. What’s interesting is children are built so that they take this non-linguistic system as rudimentary system and transform it into a real language with syntax and morphology and phonology. But a real language, which is known as creole (a language that has developed from a mixture of different languages and has become the main language in a particular place). So when you hear about a creole now of which many people speak, that remarks in this historical origin of creole was once a pidgin and has been transformed into a language and that tells us something about the human mind. There are actually some modern cases of creolization that had been studied. So imagine a child who is born deaf to hearing parents, so the parents understandably enough want to communicate with the child so they quickly learn a sign language through which to communicate with the child. Because it’s a second language learning which is difficult. The language that the parents use is more of a pidgin and children are exposed to a pidgin. But what often happens particularly if children are raised in a community of other children in the same situation? Is that they creolize, they take this simple communication system that they’re exposed to and they transform it into a full-blown language. This tells us something about our capacity and our expectations with regard to language. Every normal human has language. This is true by definition if a child reaches the age of three or four and doesn’t speak, there’s a serious problem going on which requires serious attention and that’s different from other things. Not everybody knows chess or rides a bicycle, but language seems to be the sort of thing that everybody comes to possess. It’s no surprise that there are specific areas in the brain that are devoted to language. We’ll talk a little bit more about these later on in the course. What’s a little more controversial is what these brain areas do and these genes cause. There’s no doubt that humans have a special capacity for language, but the precise nature of this capacity whether it’s something specific and designed for language or whether it’s a more general set of capacities that allow people to learn language that’s a matter of controversy. what else can we say about language? Well, when linguists talk about language, they say that language has the property of creativity and this can mean different things, it creative, is often used to describe special abilities and that’s not what we’re talking about here. For normal use of language, people can say what they choose to say and can produce a virtually infinite number of sentences by one estimate, the number of sentences under 20 words long is 1 with 30 zeros after it. So if it took you five seconds to say a sentence, in order to say all of them you’d have to spend about 100 trillion years. This suggests that language understanding, language comprehension, language production, can’t just be a matter of rote memory. If you understood what I said and understand I’m saying now, it can’t be because at some point you’ve memorized the meanings of these sentences, you have to have some way of taking strings of words that are put together in order you’ve never heard before and making sense out of them. So how do we do this? Well, we do this through rules and principles. We have these abstract and unconscious rules in our heads that let us take strings of words and make sense of them. When I’m talking about rules of language, I’m not talking about things like don’t say ain’t or don’t end a sentence with a preposition, these are not rules that you’re forced to comply within school, they’re not what linguists call prescriptive rules which is how you should use language, rather these are abstract and unconscious rules that you have. You don’t even know you have them that allow you to figure out the virtually infinite strings of sentences you could be exposed to. These are what the things that linguists study. So for instance, you hear a sentence, “The pig is eager to eat,” and instinctively you understand that the eating here is to be done by the pig. But if you hear a sentence, “The pig is easy to eat,” in the same fraction of a second you realize this means that the eating is of the pig not by the pig. Or take a sentence, “Bill knew John liked him.” Any speaker of English realizes that this could mean that Bill knew John liked Bill, it could have other meanings but it could mean that Bill knew John like Bill. But if you hear the sentence, “Bill knew that John liked himself.” This can’t mean that Bill knew that John liked Bill, it has to mean that Bill knew that John liked John. we characterize languages in terms of these rules and principles and it turns out that language can be characterized at different levels. sound system: phonology words and how words are composed: morphology how words are combined to make phrases and sentences: syntax "],

You can’t infer the meaning of a morpheme, it’s arbitrary and you have to learn it. This is different from a word because you can combine morphemes to make words. You can understand certain words even if you’ve never heard them before. Syntax is generative, allowing us to understand sentences and phrases we never heard before. Words are also generative, and that morphemes can combine together to create words we’ve never heard before.

["language-acquisition.html", "3.3 Language acquisition", " 3.3 Language acquisition Norm Chomsky is probably the best known linguists in the world. He is strongly identified to nativism. What it means for a psychologist or philosopher, is the idea that we’re born with a lot of knowledge (innate). Chomsky has argued this particularly in the domain of language. we should see the development of language not so much as learning, but as growth “No one would take seriously the proposal that the human organism learns through experience to have arms rather than wings, or that the basic structure of particular organs results from accidental experience. Language proves to be no less marvelous and intricate than these physical structures.. Why, then, should we not study the acquisition of a cognitive structure like language more or less as we study some complex bodily organ?” Now, I have some sympathy for this view and I want to, later on, present some evidence that language does seem to show certain patterns that hint at universality. Hint that in some way we can see language as akin to a bodily organ and different from a product of culture like baseball games or British history. But at the same time, it’s clear that language development does involve learning, that is, it’s impossible to explain how we come to know language without accepting that we attend to what others around us do and do as they do and pick up the way they speak. This has to be the case, because language is different. So, consider an example from each of our three domains. In English, there’s a phonetic distinction between L and R. So, I’m giving you the letters, but it’s really the sounds associated with them. We know this because words can differ in meaning, depending on which phoneme is used. There’s a different in lip, which is a part of the mouth versus rip. Which means to tear up something. The other languages don’t make this distinction. Part of what it is to come to know a language has come to learn their phonetic properties language. Another thing is part of what is to know a language is to learn the meanings of words, morphology. Finally, there’s syntax. So, in English, if you wanted to say that Bill hit John, that Bill was to hitter and John was hit, you’d say in this order, Bill hit John. If all you knew was English you would think this is inevitable, how else would you do it? But in fact, other languages just do it differently. Some languages would say, Bill hit John, by saying, Bill John hit, or even John hit Bill, where the phrases are in different order to capture the same meaning. All of this phenology, morphology and syntax has to be learned. But, as Chomsky points out, if it is learning is learning of a fundamentally different character than other forms of learning. For one thing as mentioned before, everybody learns language, it’s a universal part of development, all normal children come to have it and this is true in every human society. More interestingly, there are specific impairments of language. So, things can happen to you as an adult, like brain damage, or trauma, or stroke, or as a child as an a developmental disorder, or a genetic disorder, that could leave you bereft of language. It could leave you unable to speak or understand. This is relevant because many people believe that all that you need to learn language is, for instance, to be very smart, or to want to communicate. But plainly, that can’t be true, because there are people who are walking around who are very smart and desperately want to communicate and they can’t learn language. This supports the idea, that language is to some degree special, it is not reducible to other human capacities. Also, on the theme of learning, language is learned, but it’s not learned in through feedback or specific training. There are many people who believe that if you don’t really teach your kid to talk, your kid won’t talk. Just as in other societies, people would believe that if you don’t teach your kid to stand up or walk, he’ll never walk. There are some societies, for instance, where they pile up sand under the kids butt so they could gradually gets more and more upright until he’s walking. Anything if you didn’t do that he never learned to walk. We look at that and say that’s silly, you don’t need it, kids learn to walk on their own. But, those societies would look at our society with this obsession with flashcards, and drills, and learning how to calibrate your speech to the kid, and tremendous focus on what you say to a kid to make them learn to speak, and they’d say that’s silly, you don’t need to do that. They’re right, cross-cultural leads to great differences in how we speak to our children, or whether we speak to our young children and all. This seem to have little or no effect on whether or not kids talk, all kids talk regardless. Now, it’s also true that in Western societies people give feedback to their children. So, often you’ll correct your child if he says something. Some people have speculated along lines of behaviorism, that this feedback perhaps as a reward and punishment, shapes the child’s learning. But, we now know that this isn’t true. For one thing, you don’t need it. Again, even in Western societies some parents don’t reinforce and punish their kids for what they say and yet kids nonetheless learn to talk. Moreover, even the parents who do give their kids reinforcement and punishment don’t tend to do it for the phenology, or the morphology, or the grammar, but more for the appropriateness or cuteness of what kids say. So, we correct kids if they get their facts wrong. We don’t typically correct them if they get their grammar wrong. Children learn language by absorbing the language around them, that much has to be true. But, it doesn’t seem as if any teaching, certainly any reinforcement or punishment plays a critical role. So, what do we know about language development? Well, what I’ll do now is, I’ll just kind of walk through this stages without saying much about the psychological mechanisms that drive kids from one stage to another, but provide you with descriptive overview what happens. So, the child’s born and when a child is born, he or she likes listening to his or her own language. There’s all sorts of clever studies that explored this. What’s particularly cool is very early on, children can discriminate all the Phonemes of natural language. I said before there are many many phonemes in English and every other languages just chooses a subset of them. But kids are sensitive to them from the very start your average, your kid born in America to English-speaking parents can distinguish between bar and par, which are English distinctions, but also can make distinctions between Phonemes in Czech and Hindi, which are not expressed in English. What’s really cool is, this capacity goes away. So, this is one way in which kids are better than adults. It’s that there are not many examples of this, but this is one example. A baby can make distinctions, can hear distinctions that you can’t. This capacity you start off oversensitive and then we whittled down our sensitivity until we’re just understanding the distinctions made in their own language. Around age seven months starts babbling, kids go Ba-Ba-Ba Pa-Pa-Pa, make sounds like that. Fascinatingly, deaf children learning sign language also babble, they babble with their hands producing the equivalent of Ba-Ba-Ba Pa-Pa-Pa. At around the kids first birthday, and there’s quite a lot of variance for this, parents shouldn’t panic if kids take longer than 12 months, but you know you get the first words, mama, dada, typically words for objects, actions, properties, milk, give, up, hot, words like that. Early on using clever methods, it turns out that there are some sensitivity to word order. So, for instance, you could put a one-year-old down, even a one-year-old who isn’t yet producing sentences, and put the kid down and there’s two screens. On one screen, first, you find out the kid can recognize big burden Cookie Monster Sesame Street characters, if not you could use other characters. Then you have two screens, in one screen, big bird is pushing Cookie Monster, in the other screen, Cookie Monster’s pushing big bird, and you say to the kids something like, look big birds pushing Cookie Monster and you’ll see where the kid looks. Very early on, you find that the kid looks in an appropriate direction, in a screen that matches the English sentence expressing that action, showing that very early on you have some understanding of word order. Around 18 months, the kid starts to increase the rate of learning words, produces two word sentences, what’s called a telegraphic speech. There aren’t telegrams anymore, but telegrams used to be ways to communicate where each word you used was very expensive, so you had to kind of put things together, you wouldn’t say, “Oh, I’m traveling through Spain and I’ve lost my wallet please send me money right now”, you’d say, “Spain-lost-wallet-need-money.” That’s how kids talk early on, as if words are very expensive. Then, gradually at this point, function morphemes, we talked about them before like, in, of, a, the plural marker ‘s’, the past tense marker ‘ed’, gradually begin to appear. Language continues to develop, then at some certain point, it becomes more difficult to learn a language and people are rarely fully successful. This is true both for second languages and also studies of deaf children learning sign language for first languages. For instance, some really interesting studies to illustrate this looked at people and these were all people who have been in America for about 30 years, so they’ve learned a language as well as their aboriginal learn it. The comparison was, when did they start? Did they start as babies? Did they start as young children? Did they start as adolescents? Did they start after the age of 17? what you can see in this graph is, that the older you start, past about age three, the less good you are. So, if you start learning English at age three you’re fine, but if you start learning English at age 10, at age 15, or age 20, even if you were to speak it for 30 years, you still will not be perfectly fluent. This suggests that, the biological capacity to learn language has a clock on it. Like other capacities psychologists have studied, there’s a critical period you have to do it within a certain period of development, or you’ll never be fully successful. "],

["perception-and-attention.html", "4.1 Perception and Attention", " 4.1 Perception and Attention Perception and attention → memory: the pair tells the story of how the world gets from the outside of our heads, finds it way inside, and stays there. Big Themes Perception: the problem of perception is hard. Successful perception involves educated, unconscious guesses about the world Attention: We attend to some things but not others. We miss a surprising amount of what happens. Memory: There are many types of memory. The key is organization and understanding. You can’t trust some of your memories. 4.1.1 Problems of perception Light hits the retina and the retina is a bunch of nerve cells and these nerve cells fire and they fire at some stimulus and not others. You get the equivalent of an array of numbers corresponding with the intensity of firing. The problem of perception is, out of this array of numbers, you have to extract objects and people, where people are, what they’re doing, colors , depth and so on. Your array is a two-dimensional array and you need to infer a three-dimensional world. It’s mathematically impossible to do this with certainty. Similarly, for the world, imagine most of your retina is silent, nothing’s firing, but there’s neurons firing that corresponds to a shape and the shape is an irregular polygon. So, what’s in the world? Well, you don’t know. Think about the moon. You looking at a full moon in the sky, takes up some circular space on your eye. How do you know that it’s not a foot away, or 10 feet away, or a million miles away? For everything you see, there’s an indefinite number of possibilities as to the actual real-world things give rise to it. 4.1.2 Perception of brightness There’s more to perceiving the brightness of an object than the amount of light that hits it. Rather, we’re sensitive to the context in which the object is in. For example: Shadows make surfaces darker. So, if a surface is in shadow, we would assume that it’s lighter than it looks, and we actually see it as lighter. 4.1.3 Perception of object The Gestalt psychologists proposed principles that lead us to segment one thing from another. proximity: Things that are close together relative to other things tend to be seen as distinct. similarity: The objects gets segmented into two because there are distinct patterns. closure: continuation common movement good form 4.1.4 Perception of depth 4.1.5 Attention Our perceptual abilities let us segment the world into objects, space into things like people, trees, houses. Understand where they stand in relationship to each other. Where they stand in depth. This is just part of the story. The whole story is how it gets all the way from the world all the way into long-term memory. Attention (Sensory memory → Short term memory): when you focus the spotlight of attention onto things, it causes you to remember them and think about them. There are a lot of things that we don’t attend to Sometimes attention is effortless Sometimes attention requires effort Sometimes attention is involuntary Sensory memory is very short-term storage. If there’s a flash of lightning, and you close your eyes and there’s an after image, that’s a form of sensory memory. Short-term memory: what you attend to ends up in short-term memory or working memory. This is of course short-term memory that is not somehow rehearsed or understood, gets quickly lost. You can hold things in short-term memory through maidens rehearsal. Long-term memory is storage for a long duration. The connection between working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory goes both ways. Many psychologists identify working memory with consciousness. Working memory is your experience of what things are, of how the world works. Now the most obvious way in which long-term memory and short-term memory differ is their storage. Long-term memory has virtually unlimited storage Short-term memory in contrast has a very limited storage capacity. the storage of short-term memory, 7+/-2, George Miller chunks are basic memory units. You will get more efficient at packing information into chunks as a result of learning. So, take this example, suppose you don’t know anything about French and you get the string of letters, L-A-M-A-I-S-O-N. Well, if you just try to remember each letter separately, that’s eight chunks and you’re pushing the limits of short-term memory. Another handy you could break it up into four English words, LA-MA-IS-ON, let’s pretend la and ma are English words, now it’s four chunks. there’s a lot of evidence suggesting that people’s memory gets better as they become experts. Football coaches have an excellent memory for football diagrams, architects for logical floor plans, and chess players for chess patterns. If it makes sense to you, you could glance at this and memorize it, not because your short-term memory is more powerful in general than a non-chess expert, but rather because you break this down into a single chunk. So, how much you store into your consciousness critically depends on your knowledge. "],

Recommend movie: Memento 4.2.5 False memories How do our memories become distorted? Expectations: People have done studies where they tell people stories for instance about somebody who goes to a dentist’s office. And then later asked them what they remember of the story. They tend to fill in the details that typically occur even though they didn’t. So the story might not mention paying the bill. But somebody later will confidently remember that they’ve been told a person paid the bill because they put in that fact Leading questions will shape how you remember a scene: If you ask them questions like, did you see the children getting into a school bus? Later on, just asking that question makes them much more likely to remember the school bus in the film.

["emotions.html", "Chapter 5 Emotions", " Chapter 5 Emotions We put the study of emotions in a broader context and use it as a way to introduce some ideas about evolution, how it works, and why it’s relevant to psychology. The foundations of modern psychology: Astonishing Hypothesis, the brain is the origin of mental life, the doctrine of physicalism Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: where the brain comes from, where complex things (human, animal, plants etc.) come from Argument from Design: Quotes from theologian and doctor, William Paley: “heath, stone, watch…”, human organs, the parts of our body, are just as complicated as a watch there’s a rich parallel between biological structures and the structures made by people The eye is like a camera, both have lenses that bend light, project an image onto a light-sensitive surface behind it, either the film or the retina. Both have a focusing mechanism, a diaphragm that governs the amount of incoming light. The big difference is, there’s no such thing as a camera anywhere near as good as the human eye. So, Paley’s view is that, you see something so articulately beautifully constructed, it seems to cry out for a designer. [intelligent design] Cicero made the same argument. It has huge explanatory advantages. For one thing, it really does explain where things come from, it explains it in a way we understand. Just as we know where watches come from, now we know where eyes come from. Problem: appealing to a divine creator seems to push back the question Ultimately, we’ll want to know where such original creatures come from. there’s long been evidence for evolution. Long been evidence as seen in fossils and vestigial characteristics like the human tailbone and goosebumps, and all of the genetic and biological evidence for the continuity of other creatures. There’s a lot of room for debate over the details of evolution, but that evolution has occurred that we were not created in our current form seems reasonably indisputable. There’s poor design. our eye has a blind spot, the male urinary system, the urethra goes through the prostate gland instead of around it. This poor design seems incompatible with benevolent, and omnipotent God. "],
["why-evolution-matters.html", "Chapter 6 Why evolution matters", " Chapter 6 Why evolution matters Two ideas come together: mental life is the product of our physical brains, materialism biological entities like the brain are the products of natural selection. Brain psychology is a product of evolution. It then becomes rational to see the mind as adapted to fulfill certain tasks: perceiving the world communicating with other members of our species Misconceptions about evolution and psychology when thinking about psychology from an evolutionary point of view and here are two of them: natural selection, the forces of evolutionary adaptation cause animals to want to spread their genes The confusion here is the distinction between ultimate causation and proximate causation. ultimate causation: the reason why something has evolved, and that involves a creature’s history and the evolutionary course proximate causation: what a creature wants Argument from William James Feelings like hunger has to do with sustaining our body with this sort of utility we get from food Psychologically, people eat because the food tastes good Evolution wires up our psychology to achieve certain ends, but our psychology’s typically ignorant as to evolution’s goals. Everything should be an adaptation, that everything we do has adaptive significance exist in order to increase the reproductive success of the animal. Natural selection doesn’t directly influence behaviors, rather, natural selection evolves brains and bodies. Once they come to exist, they do all sorts of things. Some are adaptive, and others are not, and this is true for instance for hiccups or lower back pain, or self-pity. our brains have evolved over a period of many millions of years, largely adapted once we became humans and separated from other species, living roughly as hunter-gatherers or at least in some sort of small group without access to alcohol or television or Facebook or all of the things in modern technology. We haven’t adapted to live in a world with billions of people and so we might be ill-suited to do so. Some of the behaviors we do may actually be to our detriment today. One interesting evolution psychology topic: which mental traits, behaviors, desires are adaptions, which of them are accidents. Adaptions: color vision, most of our perceptual system, language (people are debating about this), sexual desire (but pornography exploits it) Non-adaption: love of television, chocolate Hard cases that nobody knows why it evolved: pleasure from art or music, female orgasm, humor, sexual violence, xenophobia [ˌzenəˈfoʊbiə] Why does poop smell bad? Why does chocolate taste good? Why do we love our children for the most part? Why do we get angry when people hit us? Why don’t we feel good when somebody does us a favor? As psychologists, we’re going to use the tools of evolutionary theory to step back and explore the nature and origins of the most intimate aspects of ourselves including our emotions. Life is impossible without emotions our emotions are shaped by cultural contexts. Depending on who you are and where you live, your emotions will be different, they’ll respond to different things. But just as we’d expect from an evolutionary perspective, they have universal roots. There are aspects of emotions that all of us share "],

In the United States, for instance, auto insurance, how much money you pay to insure your car, varies depending on how old you are and other facts about you. But at the same time, you wonder whether that would be moral if, for instance, different ethnicities had different records of safety in driving. Similarly, we allow some profiling in criminal cases. For instance, there’s a strong presupposition when there’s a violent crime that the perpetrator is male. But even if you gain some benefit through racial profiling, the cost in terms of making it to a life worse for minority members of the society outweighs any benefit that you get. Social psychologists are interested in all social aspects of stereotypes and they tend to talk about different levels and different types of stereotypes public stereotypes: what we say to other people about a group private stereotype implicit stereotypes: unconscious associations that guide us and affect us even if we’re not conscious of it IAT method: implicit.harvard.edu Many of the rest of us are at war for ourselves in that group membership matters even when we think it shouldn’t. Even when we think we want to be colorblind, we want to be gender-blind, we want to be attractiveness blind, we’re still swayed by things. It’s an interesting question how to deal with this problem and I think part of the answer is, we can use our intelligence to override our biases. That is, we don’t become less biased just by trying to be less bias rather we become less bias by using clever methods to override it. So, for instance, it used to be that for auditions for symphony orchestras, men would be overwhelmingly chosen over women, and because they sounded better according to the judges but it turns out that when you do blind auditions, you have them audition behind the screen, the effect goes away, and a gender difference largely disappears. What’s interesting here from a psychological point of view is the judges, male and female who were saying that the men sounded better than the women, were most likely not being self-consciously sexist saying,&quot; Ha ha I’m going to discriminate against women. I hate women,&quot; etc. Rather they might have entirely had egalitarian views, but because of their biases, they couldn’t help but hear them differently. Then when you hide the gender of people, you take away the chance for the biases to operate. Things change. More generally, we talked about so many social psychology biases, so many ways in which we’re contorted by first impressions, by stereotypes that we believe are inaccurate, by cognitive dissonance. The way we can make it through the world as better decision-makers and better people often is to use our intelligence to structure the world so these biases don’t apply. To put it much broader, we can use our heads to override our hearts. "],

Somebody for social phobia who’s profoundly awkward around people. Someone who’s a paranoid schizophrenic, maybe who meets the sort of ultimate stereotype of the mentally ill who might believe that his or her thoughts are being monitored by the CIA. There are reasonably clear cases of what it’s like to have a mental illness. But they’re also difficult cases. what do you deal with a successful criminal? Like Bernie Madoff who swindled people edited their life savings. where do evil end and mental illness begin? Is addiction a mental illness? Where do illness end and free will begin? This isn’t just a philosophical problem, it’s an everyday problem. How do we think about mental illness? One ancient view was it’s due to demonic possession Another view worth talking about is the labels of mental illness or what we do to people who deviate from us socially. It’s worth taking seriously because, in many countries, including what used to be the Soviet Union, dissidents, people who protested against the governments were put in insane asylums. As an example that comes closer to home, people with certain sexual desires, including homosexuality used to be counted as mentally ill by the psychological and psychiatric community. It was only in 1973 that being gay was no longer counted as a mental illness. Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz in his book “The Myth of Mental Illness” Mental illness is a myth. We call people sick mentally ill if they deviate from society, and the label of mental illness deprives them of responsibility and dismisses them. There is a recent debate for instance over neuro diversity. For instance, being mildly autistic isn’t an illness in any interesting sense, but more just diverse aspects of different ways of processing information in dealing with the world, On the other hand, it’ll be pretty clear that these really are illnesses in a very real sense. They lead up to a lack of functioning. They’re often associated with brain damage or brain trauma or unusual neurochemistry. Maybe most important with treatment, people become happier and more competent and better able to deal with the world. The medical model of mental illness: you think in terms of symptoms and an underlying disorder that is ultimately treated. "],
["schizophrenia.html", "10.1 Schizophrenia", " 10.1 Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is the most important and most terrible of all mental illnesses. By some estimates, about 1% the world’s population suffer from schizophrenia about 50% of the beds in mental hospitals are occupied by schizophrenics. It is NOT multiple personality disorder From the greek “split” and “mind”: a loss of touch of reality Positive symptoms hallucinations delusions disorganized speech disorganized behaviors Negative symptoms absence of normal cognition Subtypes of schizophrenia paranoid: delusions of persecution catatonic: unresponsive to surroundings, purposeless movement, parrot-like speech disorganized: delusions and hallucinations with little meaning, disorganized speech, behavior and flat effect Undifferentiated: others that are hard to classified The basic psychological malfunction inability to sequence and coordinate thoughts and perceptions further problems arise from loss of contact with others The basic neural malfunction too much dopamine (but it is not that simple): studies of schizophrenia find abnormally high dopamine activity. One reason to believe this is that anti-psychotic drugs have some beneficial effect on schizophrenia and they work by blocking dopamine reception at the synapse so dopamine doesn’t work as well. It’s also supported by the fact that if somebody who’s not schizophrenics takes a lot of amphetamines, you sometimes get amphetamine psychosis, which is a lot like schizophrenia. it is not that simple if it was really caused by an excess of dopamine, anti-psychotic drugs should work for everybody, but they don’t. there are structural abnormalities in the brain that can’t be accounted for by this dopamine hypothesis. There’s been a lot of studies on the heritability of schizophrenia, and there’s a powerful role of genetics. A close biological relative has schizophrenia, your increase in likely to have it yourself. In fact, if your identical twin has it, you’re about 50 percent likely to have it. But it is not 100%. environmental triggers difficult birth some potential viral infections more schizophrenics are born in the winter than in summer Then later in life, it may be due to stress-producing circumstances or a difficult family environment, and in fact, schizophrenics report more of these than non-schizophrenic. But, it’s a complicated problem to determine cause and effect here. For instance, it might be that schizophrenics early on are showing schizophrenics symptoms which leads to more difficulties in the families or more stressful environments, it also might mean that people who know they have mental illnesses are more prone to remember bad events.

["mood-disorders.html", "10.2 Mood disorders", " 10.2 Mood disorders Mood disorders are the most common type of mental illness and they come in two general forms (15%): Depression: aka. major depressive disorder Different from “it’s been a bad day. I’m pretty depressed” severely depressed mood that last two or more weeks. it is accompanied by lack of pleasure, lethargy, and sleep and appetite disturbances. No “reasonable” cause At least 2 weeks, average episode is 12 weeks Affect women more than men. Why? different theories: harder life, less income, poverty, hormone, men are less to report the symptoms, men deny and distract themselves when facing life stressor while women may accept what is going on and ruminate about it. Depression is heritable. Neurotransmitters are involved in depression. Low level of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin causes depression. But it is not as simple as this. It usually takes weeks for the drug to work which makes the neurochemical story more complicated. From a psychological level, the core problem seems to be negatively biased thoughts. But there is not much evidence that depressed people had a bad pattern of thought before they had depression. So this pattern of thought is likely to be the consequence of depression, not the cause. The most extreme manifestation of depression is suicide. Bipolar less common than depression, about 1% Swing back and forth from mania to depression "],

Affects about 5% of people at some time in their lives Physical symptoms: headaches, stomachaches, muscle tension, irritability Has some genetic component Related genetically to major depression and childhood trauma Genetic predisposition or childhood trauma → Hyper-vigilance → GAD Phobias Classical conditioning theory: you got bite by a dog. You become afraid of dog.

The problems that people struggle with that bring them to the therapist’s office are symptoms. You should focus instead on underlying causes. Classical Freudian Psychoanalysis is a lengthy process, often going on for years, involving many sessions a week, and involves techniques like free association, the therapist might say some words and the patient will say something back, and dream analysis, where dreams are explored in order to give insight into what the mental problem is. Behavior therapy Motivated by B.F.Skinner operant conditioning are used to reinforce good behaviors and diminish bad behaviors many of the treatments of phobia use the techniques of classical conditioning, where objects that would frighten you, instead of being associated with fear, you learned to associate them with relaxation and calm.

We know that the brain is the source of mental life, but we don’t have any real understanding of how a physical object, a lump of meat, can give rise to conscious experience. We haven’t yet solved what philosophers call, the hard problem. We know that about half the variation in personality is a result of genes, and so too for intelligence and happiness, and many other things, but we don’t really know how to explain where the other half comes from, what experiences make us what we are. We know about the social influences that can make us do certain things, including bad things, but we don’t yet know why some people are immune to these influences, and act and sometimes do great and heroic things, regardless of the circumstances that they find themselves in. Optimism The most important and intimate aspects of ourselves, our beliefs and emotions, the capacity to make decisions, our sense of right and wrong, can be explained through constructing and testing scientific hypotheses.
