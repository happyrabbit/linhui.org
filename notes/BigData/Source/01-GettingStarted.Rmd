# Getting Started

Everyone should have heard about big data. However, a lot of data on its own is worthless. It isn’t the size of the data that’s important. It’s what you do with it. 

One thing that empowers big data is cloud computing or on demand computing. Cloud computing is one of the ways in which computing has now become something that we can do anytime, anywhere. You may be surprised to know that some of your favorite apps are from businesses being run from coffee shops. This new ability, combined with our torrent of data, gives us the opportunity to perform novel, dynamic and scalable data analysis, to tell us new things about our world and ourself. To summarize, a new torrent of big data combined with computing capability anytime, anywhere has been at the core of the launch of the big data era.
