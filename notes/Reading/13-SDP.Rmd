Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize. There is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another, even when we know it's going to make us feel worse. Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids.

Getting over heartbreak is not a journey. It is a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon. There is no breakup explanation that is going to feel satisfying. No rationale can take away the pain you feel. So don't search for one. Don't wait for one, just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself and then put the question to rest, because you need that closure to resist the addition. And you need something else as well: you have to be willing to let go, to accept that it's over. Otherwise, your mind will feed on your hope and set you back. Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken.
