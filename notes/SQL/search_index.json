["getting-started.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Started 1.1 What is SQL?", " Chapter 1 Getting Started In this section, you will be able to define SQL and discuss how SQL differs from other computer languages. You will be able to compare and contrast the roles of a database administrator and a data scientist, and explain the differences between one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships with databases. You will be able to use the SELECT statement and talk about some basic syntax rules. You will be able to add comments in your code and synthesize its importance. Learning Objectives Distinguish between use of SQL for data science applications and SQL for more common data management operations. Use an Entity Relationship diagram, describing the data elements, their relationships and inter-dependencies and determine if the existent data is sufficient to address a business question. Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write and SQL query to limit to those results. Create an analysis environment and use INSERT to put data into a table Add effective comments in your queries so that: You can remember what you are doing others can review your work 1.1 What is SQL? Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. SQL is used often to query, insert, update and modify data. At a basic level, SQL is a way to communicate with database. Many SQL commands are descriptive words and easy to interpret compared to many other computer languages. This makes SQL an easy to understand and learn language. Another important thing to know about SQL is that it is a non-procedural language. That means you won’t be able to write complete applications with it. This makes SQL relatively simple but also very powerful language to interact with data. SQL is all about data and it is used for three things: read and retrieve data from database write data into database update and insert new data Different SQL users There are a lot of jobs requre SQL and it is not just for data science. It is important to understand how different roles might use SQL in their jobs. The users can be data scientist, programmers, backend developer, QA engineers, data architects, system engineers and database administrators (DBA). I want to talk a little more about how DBA use SQL comparing to data scientist. A DBA is responsible for managing the entire database and guarding it. A data scientist, on the other hand, is typically a user of that database. The DBA will be responsible for giving permissions to people and determining who has access to what data. They are often responsible for managing the tables and creating them. Data scientist need to get the rights from DBA to create his/her own table and insert data into them. The two roles are similar in that they both use SQL to interact with the data. But the main difference is that the data scientist is really the end user. Whereas the DBA is the one who administers it, governs it and manages the database, as a whole. Database Admin Data Scientist Manages/governs entire database End user of a database Gives permissions to users Retrieve data (mainly) Determines access to data May create their own table or test environment Manages and creates tables Combine multiple sources together Uses SQL to query and retrive data Writes complex queries for analysis (maybe but usually not) SQL and Database Management System(DBMS) Despite SQL being standardized since 1986, a lot of different implementations exist. They deviate more or less from each other. You can think of SQL as the interpreter between you and the database. How you write some of the syntax for SQL depends on the relational database management system you are using. Here are some of the popular ones: SQL Server IBM DB2 Oracle Sybase ASE PostgreSQL MySQL Microsoft SQL Server Apache Open Office Base SQLite In this text, we’ll use SQLite. It’s important to understand that if you copy code from this text into another application at work, it may not work correctly. You should check the type of DBMS you’re using and see if that makes a difference. We will talk about this more when we get to the syntax later including some of the ways to figure out what those differences might be. Summary points: How you write syntax will depend on what DBMS you are using Each DBMS has its own “dialect” SQL can translate You will tweak based on the “dialect” your DMBS speaks "],

Understanding your data means the following: Understand the business process or subject matter the data is modeled after Know the business rules Understand how your data is organized and structured in the table Before you start to write a query, think about: what is the problem you are trying to solve? what is the data you need to get? how does the data relate to each other? how does it interact? what are some of the problems that you may want to solve with this data and need to be aware of? what are the types of joints or business processes in the data modeling? This will really help you because not only will you get more accurate results, but also speed up the time it takes you to work and get things done. If you start to think about what you’re doing before you do it, you should hopefully also have less rework. Now what is a database and what is a table? Database: A container (usually a file or set of files) to stre organized data; a set of related information Tables: A structured list of data or a specific type A database is really a container that is usually a file or set of files and is used to organize and store all of the data. If you think of this in real world terms, It’d be like a filing system that has many cabinets along a wall. Within that system, within a database, we have tables, these tables are structured lists of data elements or specific data type. Going back to our analogy, you can think of this as maybe one of the cabinets within a whole wall of cabinets. Then if we dive further into the cabinet, into a table, what we find is we have columns and rows, which of course is what makes up a table. A table is made up of a series of individual columns, and then a row and a table is a record. Through tables, rows, and columns, ultimately throughout the database we have a mechanism to store and retrieve data. 2.2 What is data model? Data model is what we use to organize information for multiple tables and how they relate to each other together. This helps tremendously in providing structure to the information in the system. Usually a data model represents a business process and it also helps you understand a business process. As a data scientist, you often need to work with a business person in understanding the data and how it fits together. But at the same time, the business person will learn a lot from the data modeller to better understand how their business actually works together by seeing the data and how it interacts with each other. The data model here is not predictive model which a data scientist often build. It is a way the tables are represented and organized in a database. One thing to remember is that a data model should always represent a real world problem as closely as possible. There are couple different types of models, and there has been an evolution of data models. The evolution of data model traces back to 1960s. There’s been hierarchical, network, relational, entity, relational somatic, and NoSql. Here we will briefly talk a little about the relational and NoSql. Because we are going to work a lot with relational model. If you are interested in learning more, there is material widely available on the internet and you can do your own research. The benefits of a relational model are: simplify the connections between the data allow you to write queries (retrieve/update/write data) easily NoSQL was part of the Big Data movement that you should have already heard about. It is a mechanism for storage and retrieval where it’s not modeled in a tabular relational format. NoSQL was popular when big data and unstructured data first came out because you left it unstructured, but it’s now started to soften a little bit, and more commonly referred to as Not Only SQL. One question to think about: does SQL really have a role still in the Big Data world, as new things start to come out like NoSQL and unstructured data? Next let’s talk about the difference between relational and transactional databases. A relational model is a database design that shows the relationships between the different tables, optimizes querying data, makes it easy and intuitive to access the data. Transactional model is a more operational database. If you are in healthcare, for example, you may have a transactional database that is used to store all the claims information and then this information may not be stored in a great way for querying and using it for analysis. In fact, you may need to take and extract that transactional information from the database and move it into a relational model. Most of what we will be working with is the relational model. There are 3 building blocks for relational model: Entities: a person, place, thing or event. These are very distinguishable, unique and distict. Attributes: characteristics of this entity. Relationships: associations among different entities, can be one-to-many, many-to-many and one-to-one. For example, Pioneer has a great corn seed product called P1197 which could be an entity. And then we have attributes that are characteristics of P1197, such as price, average yeilds, units sold, promotion programs. If you think of a one-to-many relationship, this could be P1197 has many promotion programs. When you think of a many-to-many relationship, this could be an example of many products to many different promotion programs. You may have one product that belongs to different programs or you may have a program that is available for different products. Then, if you think of a one-to-one relationship, it could be one product has a unique price. To understand these relationships between the tables a lot better, what’s often used to depict this are ER diagrams. ER model is composed of entity types and specific relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types. These are usually displayed in a visual format and a relate represents a relationship between the tables. It often helps you to understand and represent a business process and it will show the links between these tables. The links are important when we join these tables. Being able to look at this diagram and see how they relate to each other is really important. We can use the primary key or foreign key to join tables. The primary key is a column or set of columns whose values uniquely identify every row in a table. Foreign key is one or more columns can be used together to identify a single row in another table. When we’re looking at ER diagrams, which again is one of the ways you will start to think before you do, you’ll look at maybe an ER diagram and understand what data elements you are trying to join together and how do you need to get them. But one of the things you need to understand is how to read this. We talked a little bit about relationships and the different relationships between a table. There is a different type of notation that explains the relationships. Chen notation Crow’s foot notation UML class diagram notation The Chen notation uses 1:M for a one-to-many relationship, and M:N for a many-to-many relationship and 1:1 for a one-to-one relationship. In Crow’s foot notation, we have the train tracks which represent 1 and then the Crow’s foot which represents many. In UML notation, we have a 1.1 which represents the concept of one and 1.* which represents the concept of many. Get familar with the different notations since you’ll be looking at ER diagrams quite frequently and you’ll need to understand these notations when reading ER diagrams so you can understand how you’re going to write your query and join the table together or even to find out what’s listed in the table. Having a good understanding of why the data is structured in a particular way and how to read the ER diagrams is necessary for writing queries and ensuring accurate results. 2.3 Retrive data with SELECT The majority of what data scientists are doing with SQL is retrieving data. To get started, the first statement to learn is SELECT. There are two pieces of information to specify in SELECT statement: what to select and where it is from. It will be straightforward with an example. SELECT prod_name FROM Products; prod_name Shampoo Toothpaste Deodorant Toothbrush Ihis example selects product name which a column from the table (prod_name). Then you need to specify where to get it from. Here it is from a table named Products. The output of this is then going to look like the column listed below. Which it has a column product name and then all of the list of products. We have shampoo, toothpaste, deodorant, and toothbrush. If you want to retrieve more than a single column from a table, then what you need to add the names of the individual columns separated with a comma: SELECT prod_name, prod_id, prod_price FROM Products; Request all columns by using the asterisk (*) wildcard character instead of column names: SELECT * FROM Products; This is going to go ahead and grab everything from the Products table, each individual column, and put it into your output. A lot of times we may want get a view of the table to understand what data is in there without pulling all the records. In this case, we may do a “SELECT *”. But if there are 5 million records in it, we just need a tiny sample of that. In this case, we can use LIMIT to limit the results. SELECT prod_name FROM Products LIMIT 5; Here is an example of how different RDMS differ in syntax: If you are using SQLite and understand it’s LIMIT 5. When switch over to a DB2 system, you can easily Google in terms of the syntax in DB2. 2.4 Create table As a data scientist, you are always building models and making predictions. You may want to take those predictions that you create and write them back to a database. This ensures that someone else could then pick up those predictions and use them in a dashboard. Or you may want to create a dashboard or visualize it with another tool that can be hooked up and used with that database. It’s also helpful if you’re extracting data off the web or scraping it from somewhere and you want to store this data in a database. As we have previously discussed, the data scientist isn’t usually the one in charge of managing the entire database, that usually left to the DBA or some type of administrator. Even so, it’s helpful to have a basic understanding of how this works. You can use the statement CREATE TABLE to do this. CREATE TABLE Shoes ( Id char(10) PRIMARY KEY, Brand char(10) NOT NULL, Types char(250) NOT NULL, Color char(250) NOT NULL, Price decimal(8,2) NOT NULL, Descp Varchar(750) NULL ); In the above example, you create a table named “Shoes” by putting the name after CREATE TABLE. Then define the list of columns in the brackets. The first column is Id. It is a character with lenth 10. And the Id is going to be primary key. So you define data type (how many characters or decimals you allow to be inserted into this column), whether or not you allow null values. By default, it assumes that null values are accepted. The syntax for creating these tables varies greatly by relational database management system that you’re using. The above example exhibits the basic structure to create a table. However, it’s important to check the specifications and syntax of the relational database management system you’re using. An important thing to note when creating a table is to define whether a column can contain a null value or is a primary key. There are several things to pay special attention here: Don’t confuse null value with empty string. Null value is the absence of everything, whereas empty string is a value there, such as space. A primary key cannot accept null values. The Id in the example can never have an empty value or not any value. If you indicate that a column cannot be null, then you will get an error if there is any missing value in that column. There are two ways to incert data to the table after defining the variables: Use INSERT INTO statement INSERT INTO Shoes VALUES ( &#39;14535974&#39;, &#39;Gucci&#39;, &#39;Slippers&#39;, &#39;Pink&#39;, &#39;695.00&#39;, NULL ); The first method will take the first value indicated and put it in the first column; the second value will go to the second column, and so on and so forth. It works. However, a potential problem of this method is that you have no guarantee that data is going into the correct column. It is better to be more specific. Use INSERT INTO and VALUES INSERT INTO Shoes (Id, Brand, Types, Color, Price, Descp ) VALUES ( &#39;14535974&#39;, &#39;Gucci&#39;, &#39;Slippers&#39;, &#39;Pink&#39;, &#39;695.00&#39;, NULL ); The second method also lists the columns. This can be really beneficial if you want to insert values into some columns but not all. I will recommend using this method. It’s a little safer because you have more control and know exactly which value is going and into which column. Now you have learned how to create tables using SQL. There’s another thing you can do with tables which is to create a temporary table. "]
