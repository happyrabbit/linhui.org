<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why thinking beforing coding is important</li>
<li>Explain why it is important to understand how the data in a database relates to one another</li>
<li>Describe what a databse is at its core</li>
<li>Describe data models</li>
<li>Define relational database system</li>
<li>Discuss advent of relational databases in SQL</li>
</ul>
<div id="think-before-code" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Think before code</h2>
<p>The reason why thinking beforing coding is importan is because you have to understand the structure of the data well to effectively write queries. Understanding your data means the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the business process or subject matter the data is modeled after</li>
<li>Know the business rules</li>
<li>Understand how your data is organized and structured in the table</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you start to write a query, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>what is the data you need to get?</li>
<li>how does the data relate to each other?</li>
<li>how does it interact?</li>
<li>what are some of the problems that you may want to solve with this data and need to be aware of?</li>
<li>what are the types of joints or business processes in the data modeling?</li>
</ul>
<p>This will really help you because not only will you get more accurate results, but also speed up the time it takes you to work and get things done. If you start to think about what you’re doing before you do it, you should hopefully also have less rework.</p>
<p>Now what is a database and what is a table?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Database</strong>: A container (usually a file or set of files) to stre organized data; a set of related information</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tables</strong>: A structured list of data or a specific type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A database is really a container that is usually a file or set of files and is used to organize and store all of the data. If you think of this in real world terms, It’d be like a filing system that has many cabinets along a wall. Within that system, within a database, we have tables, these tables are structured lists of data elements or specific data type. Going back to our analogy, you can think of this as maybe one of the cabinets within a whole wall of cabinets. Then if we dive further into the cabinet, into a table, what we find is we have columns and rows, which of course is what makes up a table. A table is made up of a series of individual columns, and then a row and a table is a record. Through tables, rows, and columns, ultimately throughout the database we have a mechanism to store and retrieve data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-data-model" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> What is data model?</h2>
<p>Data model is what we use to organize information for multiple tables and how they relate to each other together. This helps tremendously in providing structure to the information in the system. Usually a data model represents a business process and it also helps you understand a business process. As a data scientist, you often need to work with a business person in understanding the data and how it fits together. But at the same time, the business person will learn a lot from the data modeller to better understand how their business actually works together by seeing the data and how it interacts with each other.</p>
<p>The data model here is not predictive model which a data scientist often build. It is a way the tables are represented and organized in a database. One thing to remember is that a data model should always represent a real world problem as closely as possible. There are couple different types of models, and there has been an evolution of data models.</p>
<p>The evolution of data model traces back to 1960s. There’s been hierarchical, network, relational, entity, relational somatic, and NoSql.</p>

</div>
<p>Here we will briefly talk a little about the relational and NoSql. Because we are going to work a lot with relational model. If you are interested in learning more, there is material widely available on the internet and you can do your own research.</p>
<p>The benefits of a relational model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simplify the connections between the data</li>
<li>allow you to write queries (retrieve/update/write data) easily</li>
</ul>
<p>NoSQL was part of the Big Data movement that you should have already heard about. It is a mechanism for storage and retrieval where it’s not modeled in a tabular relational format. NoSQL was popular when big data and unstructured data first came out because you left it unstructured, but it’s now started to soften a little bit, and more commonly referred to as Not Only SQL.</p>
<ul>
<li>does SQL really have a role still in the Big Data world, as new things start to come out like NoSQL and unstructured data?</li>
</ul>
