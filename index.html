<p>As a statistician, I believe no one is able to say "'As surely as I live" except the God. Statistician takes calculated risk. We are trying to penetrate the visible surface of the world, to ponder deeper on both grace and sin. Whatever we do, however far we go, we should not stop endeavoring to get closer to God. </p>
