  As a statistician, I believe no one is able to say "'As surely as I live" except the God. Statistician takes 
  calculated risk. We are trying to penetrate the visible surface of the world, to ponder deeper on both grace 
  and sin. Whatever we do, however far we go, we should not stop thinking. </ul>
