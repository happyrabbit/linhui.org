  <!--As a statistician, I believe no one is able to say "'As surely as I live" except the God. Statistician takes 
  calculated risk. We are trying to penetrate the visible surface of the world, to ponder deeper on both grace 
  and sin. Whatever we do, however far we go, we should not stop thinking.--> 
  <li> Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. [George E. P. Box] </li>

 <li> Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. [Albert Einstein] </li>
  
 <li> Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind. [Albert Einstein]</li>
  
  <li>The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources. [Albert Einstein]</li>
  
  <li>Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. [Albert Einstein]</li>
  
  <li>Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better. [Albert Einstein]</li>
  
  <li>There are some humans who have worked very, very intensely for very, very long time periods and thus know some things very, very well. [Prof. Norm Matlof]</li>
